I recently bought a little synthesizer/groovebox called <a href="https://teenage.engineering">OP-Z</a> by Teenage Engineering. It's tiny and limited, but a ton of fun and somehow the limitations work for me - I find myself actually creating music with it.

During January, I participated in something called `#jamuary` on instagram. Basically I created and posted a little musical clip every day. Sometimes it was part of a song, sometimes just a little jam, but I did manage to post something every day.

Once January was done, I started thinking about turning these jams into a "real" album. Of course it's self-published and unprofessionally mastered and so on, but still.

I'm calling the project *Oferlund* and the album *Vemod*, it should be out on all of the major streaming services in mid March, and it consists of 9 tracks and 45 minutes of music.

Here's the cover:

It's possible that this music appeals to no one except myself. Still, I do like it, and that's enough for me.
