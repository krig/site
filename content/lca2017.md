#### Swedes and swearing

In the beginning of the talk I mention that swedes don't understand
swearing, but I didn't do a great job of explaining what I
meant. Here's a (hopefully) more understandable version.

First of all, what are swear words? I'm not a linguist, but I would
call them *amplifiers*. A swear word expresses an amplified emotion.

* Good
* Very Good
* Really Good
* Damn Good
* Really Fucking Good

In this sense, the swedish language does have swear words, as in words
that are used as emotional amplifiers. But the amplifiers in swedish
are just that. They are largely meaningless words that reference
devils or hell that don't have any other connotations that might
offend someone. So in swedish, you'd say

* Bra (Good)
* Jättebra (Really Good /*Giant Good*/)
* Skitbra (Damn Good /*Shit Good*/)
* Jävligt Bra (Really Fucking Good /*Devilishly Good*/)

As you can see, that last one doesn't quite match the english
variant. Due to this, swearing in swedish isn't really all that
frowned upon. You may have heard someone say "Oh, in Sweden they are
so enlightened and liberal, they don't bleep words on TV" or something
similar, or maybe you've even heard a swede say this and not
understanding why you'd bleep words in other countries.

Well, this non-understanding carries over when learning a second
language. As it seems to me,
my brain still basically forms sentences in Swedish, selecting words
from categories like verb, noun and amplifier. So when building
sentences, my brain will insert swedish "swears" here and there - as
we do.

It then starts translating the sentence to english, first by replacing
words in each category with the closest matching word in
english. Well, having largely learned to speak english by watching
films by Quentin Tarantino, the sentences tend to end up containing
quite a bit of fucking, and possibly one or two motherfuckers. The
next step is to rearrange and throw away words that don't make sense,
and adding words where needed. And the step after that is to look at
the whole sentence, go "hmm, this sounds a bit too rude doesn't it"
and strip out much of the fucking and the motherfuckers.

Well, when in a high pressure situation, having to both think and
speak quickly, such as when speaking at a conference, the brain is apt
to start dropping frames. And it does this by dropping stages of the
internal translation process. So maybe I'll start getting word order
wrong, or some word might not get translated properly and come out in
swedish. Or, the cleanup phase that tries to get the sentence back to
the intended level of swearyness drops off and I start sounding like
an angry sailor.

Again, not a linguist, not an expert. This is likely to be a grossly
oversimplified version of the real mechanism. But it seems somewhat
accurate.
