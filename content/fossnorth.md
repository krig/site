FOSS North, 2019. Second revision of this talk.

It's not exactly the same talk as at LCA, in part because I am terrible at sticking to a script but also because I rewrote
at least half of the presentation, expanding on some parts and trying to actually get to the part where I implement a lisp
interpreter.
