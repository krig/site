Presentation I did at linux.conf.au 2019 about the history of Lisp,
computers and programming in general.

Got written up as an article on <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/778550/">LWN.net</a>
to my delight, and so far the comments have generally been surprisingly positive pretty
much everywhere.

On April 7 (2019), I will be doing an updated version of this talk at
<a href="https://foss-north.se/">FOSS North</a> in Gothenburg - my time
slot is 15 minutes longer, so I might actually get through most of the
talk this time.
