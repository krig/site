This presentation was given at openSUSEconf 2016 in Nuremberg, Germany.

In it, I presented Hawk 2.0, demonstrating how to set up a live cluster and
showing off some of the new features in the second major release.

Around this time I also created a website for Hawk which unfortunately (as of
    January 2020) hasn't been updated since: https://hawk-ui.github.io/
