This is the personal website of __Kristoffer Gr&ouml;nlund__. I like
making things. I'm a software developer by day, so a lot of what I
make is in the form of source code. I also make music, art and
houses - and possibly other things.

I'm not sure exactly what my idea behind this site is. Once,
having a personal website was an essential part of the web
experience. These days it seems less relevant. Maybe it can
serve as a CV of sorts, or maybe it's just a reminder to
myself of the things I've done.

Here are some links to other things I've made or been involved in:

* [Kodsnack](http://kodsnack.se) - A coding podcast in swedish
* [github.com/krig](https://github.com/krig) - Random source code I've put on GitHub
* [soundcloud.com/kodkrig](https://soundcloud.com/kodkrig) - Random noises I've put on Soundcloud
