This is the personal website of __Kristoffer Gr&ouml;nlund__. Unless you
know who that is, nothing on this page is likely to interest you. On
the other hand, if you already know who that is, why read this at all?

If, after all, you do know me, it may be from such features as

* [kodsnack](http://kodsnack.se) - A coding podcast in swedish
* [crmsh](http://crmsh.github.io) - A cluster command line shell
* [hawk](https://github.com/ClusterLabs/hawk) - A cluster web interface
* [world in conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_in_Conflict) - A real-time strategy game
* [github.com/krig](https://github.com/krig) - Some other random source code I've put on Github

This site is not a regular blog. I've tried to make that happen, but
lets face it. Blogs are dead. I have a [tumblr](http://koru.se), feel
free to read that -- but to be honest, I've given up on the tumblr as
well. I'm also on twitter as
[@isallmaroon](https://twitter.com/isallmaroon).
