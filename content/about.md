This is the personal website of __Kristoffer Gr&ouml;nlund__. Unless you
already know who that is, nothing on this page is likely to interest
you.

If, after all, you do know me, it may be from such features as

* [Kodsnack](http://kodsnack.se) - A coding podcast in swedish
* [crmsh](https://crmsh.github.io) - A cluster command line shell
* [Hawk](https://hawk-ui.github.io) - A cluster web interface
* [World in Conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_in_Conflict) - A real-time strategy game
* [github.com/krig](https://github.com/krig) - Other random source code I've put on Github

This site is not a regular blog. I have tried to make that happen, but
let's face it. Blogs are dead.

I do have a [tumblr](http://koru.se) which I update roughly once per
year, and a [twitter](https://twitter.com/iskrig) account which I
can't seem to get rid of.
