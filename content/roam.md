Here, at the very last day of 2019, I thought I should start a series of posts documenting some of the hobby
projects I've created through the years. Most of them can be found on <a href="https://github.com/krig">github</a>,
at least the ones that are in source code form.

`R O A M` was a Hackweek project at SUSE, in which I wanted to implement a basic Minecraft-style landscape
renderer in C. Source code available at <a href="https://github.com/krig/roam">github.com/krig/roam</a>.

Most of the code was written during that week in October 2014, and since then I've mostly just fixed little bugs
or made small tweaks to the code.

I probably won't continue work on this code base, but my ambition is to start a similar project in Rust at some point.
