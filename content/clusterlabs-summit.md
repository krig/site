In 2017, I organized a conference for the first and only time. This was the
[Clusterlabs](https://www.clusterlabs.org) semi-regular developer conference for
the Linux HA / Clusterlabs community. It was generally a success, attended by
people from various companies and places, and surprisingly not a terrible amount
of work to arrange. This despite the fact that the conference was held in
Nuremberg, Germany while I live in Sweden and work remotely.

There is a really nice write-up of the conference by Tanja from SUSE
[here](https://www.suse.com/c/art-clustering-dinos-elephants-clusterlabs-summit-nuremberg-2017/).
