The other day I presented Rook and Ceph at [OpenInfra Forum #8](https://www.meetup.com/OpenStack-User-Group-Sweden/) in Stockholm.

I was told that there's going to be video published of the talk eventually, but
here are the slides as [PDF](/Intro-to-Rook-2020.pdf) for anyone who might be
interested, and there's a web version [here](/intro-to-rook/).

I used [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) to make the
presentation, if you are interested you can get the sources
[here](https://github.com/krig/intro-to-rook/).
